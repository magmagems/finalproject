#### For our final project, we decided to create a fantasy scene featuring some interesting procedural textures including- magma, gems, and cooled lava. Our team size was perfect to allow for each of us to focus on one material, then work together to bring the components together.  With this, our first goal was to implement a Github architecture that would allow us to synchronize our files as we worked.  After Github was set up, we each began working in Substance Designer and then imported our works into a single Unreal Engine scene.  Daniel primarily focused on the Github, Maya modeling, the hard lava floor, and lighting; Ashley focused on the crystal gem Substance Design and Unreal Engine integration; and Ben focused on Github, the moving magma Substance Design, and Unreal Engine integration.
